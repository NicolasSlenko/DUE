            <p> <br><br> DUE stands for Discord User Enhcanement. <br><br>As the name suggests, our goal is to improve the discord user experience through the use of a discord bot</p>
            <p><br> DUE is primarily responsible for three things: banning words, punishing users for using banned words, and managing the content in certain text channels</p>
            <p><br> DUE is a project started by three high school students with the vision of creating something that can positively impact communities across discord, which currently has over 150m active users </p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'rectangle b'>
            <p><br><br>To combat banning words, DUE has a unique banned word list for each server that admins can add to in order to delete messages that contain banned words instantly. This is very useful for unwanted words like profanity that can be deleted automatically. The banned words list can also be cleared and have certain words removed if admins feel it is necessary</p>
            <p><br>To punish users for using banned words, DUE has a strike system that adds a strike every time a word from the banned word list is used. The server can set a warning for when a user reaches a certain amount of strikes and will let the server know when the user has exceeded this amount. Commands can also be used to see the number of strikes that each user has and can clear the strikes of a user if necessary
            </p> 
            <p><br>Lastly, to have more controlled text channels, DUE has the capability of only allowing certain types of messages to be sent in specific channels (ex: sound, text, video). If an unwanted message type is present in a certain channel, it will automatically be deleted
